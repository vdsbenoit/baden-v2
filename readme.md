# Baden app (v2)

## v2
The idea of this project was to transition from a containerized python backend to a serverless Ionic app, with Firebase.

It was later abandoned in order to use Vue instead of Angular (see [v3](https://gitlab.com/vdsbenoit/bb-frontend)).

## Context
The goal of this app is to manage a kind of tournament played by a large number of players IRL. 
It was initially designed for a boyscout game I used to coordinate, called [Baden Battle](https://badenbattle.be/). At the first editions, there were only a few hundreds of people playing. Everything was done on paper (distributing the players across the games, recording the scores, etc). However, the game gained a lot of success and hosts now more than 1000 players. The purpose of this app is to face the scaling issue we faced.
